## DEVELOPMENT

- Ideally use ./scripts/setup_server.sh or run the command inside there manually to set up server / db
- To run client, go into client/app and run 'yarn start' after 'yarn install'
    - client takes up lots of memory / storage so it takes a long time to dockerize

## STRUCTURE

### DB

TimescaleDB (https://www.timescale.com/)

### Server 

FastAPI (https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/)

### Client 

React, TypeScript, Redux
