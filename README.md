Please read through this entire README!

## DEVELOPMENT

- There IS hot reloading for the client in docker-compose
- Use rebuild scripts to rebuild parts of the stack during development

## SETUP

1. init_submodules.sh (see 'SCRIPTS')
2. For each sub repo you will have to 'git branch' as needed (it will likely put you in a detached GIT head) 
3. Test entire system 
    - ./scripts/setup.sh 
    - ./scripts/teardown.sh 
4. Test specific docker instances within sub-repos (read their README.md)

## SCRIPTS

IMPORTANT SCRIPTS: 
- init_submodules.sh : used for setting up subrepos 
- update_submodules.sh : used for updating subrepos 
- setup.sh : sets up all the commponents 
- teardown.sh : shuts down the components 
- rebuild_... : rebuild ... part of stack 
    - client.sh 
    - db.sh
    - server.sh
